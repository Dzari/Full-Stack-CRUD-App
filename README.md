# Full-Stack CRUD App

This repository contains a **mock CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app demonstration** built using a full-stack approach. The project is organized into two parts within the same repository: the frontend and the backend. This README provides all the instructions you need in one file.

## Technologies Used

**Frontend:**
- Typescript React – A library for building user interfaces.
- HTML, CSS, TypeScript – Core web technologies.
- Material UI - Out of the box web interfaces.

**Backend:**
- Node.js – JavaScript runtime environment.
- Express.js – Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- Serverless, BodyParser - Utility technologies for ease of use.

## Installation and Running the App

The repository contains two folders: `frontend` and `backend`. Follow the steps below to install and start both parts of the application.

### 1. Installation

Open a terminal and run the following commands in each folder.

**For the Frontend:**
cd frontend
npm install

**For the Backend:**
cd backend
npm install

### 2. Starting the Application
After installing dependencies, start both servers.

To Start the Frontend:
cd frontend
npm start

To Start the Backend:
cd backend
npm start

Usage
Once both servers are running, open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by the frontend server (typically http://localhost:3000). From there, you can interact with the app and perform CRUD operations as demonstrated.
